# tools-i-use
This is a curated list of tools that I use, or have used. I use some of these things every day, soeme I only tinker with and a few were heavily used, at one time. 

I think that this list would just clog up the blog and I'm too lazy to set up my own wiki. This just an idea for now, it certainly needs editting.
