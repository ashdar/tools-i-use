GitHub provides a [wiki](https://github.com/ashdar/tools-i-use/wiki), so I'll be moving these notes to the wiki as I get time.

This is a curated list of tools that I use, or have used. I use some of these things every day, some I only tinker with and a few were heavily used, at one time. 

I think that this list would just clog up the blog and I'm too lazy to set up my own wiki. 

This just an idea for now, it certainly needs editting. Actually, it is two ideas:
1. Keep a list of useful things that I can refer people to
1. Improve my Markdown skills. Nothing teaches as well as "doing" teaches. The first thing I have been taught is that GitHub's Markdown preview can be quirky.

At some point, I may convert some of my bookmarks to pages here. This makes it easier to share my learnings.

# Platforms-Version Control Systems
## [GitHub](https://www.github.com)
GitHub revolutionized online software projects. You are soaking in it right now. GitHub was purchased by Microsoft in 2018.

## [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com)

If you fear Microsoft, you are probably using GitLab.
## [TFSOnline](https://tfsonline.microsoft.com)

I used Microsoft online for a while. I still have a project or two that I can't easily open-source stored on TFS Online.
## Subversion

This was a fairly popular thing, before git took off.

# Platforms-Operating Systems
## [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows)
## [debian](https://www.debian.org)
I used debian on my personal rigs for a couple of years. When I want a linux distro, maybe to add to my car keys, I still reach for this one.
## [ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.org)
I used ubuntu on my personal laptop for a year or so.
## Ubuntu on Windows
I have been tinkering with this.
## Google Cloud Shell 
I tinker with this. It can be handy to be able to ping my home network from outside of the perimeter, and this is cheaper than a VPS.
## [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)
I'm really just starting out with this. I think that this is the future for many, many organizations.
## Chocolatey
Chocolatey is great if you don't have an absolute requirement to set up WSUS.

# Programming Tools
## Visual Studio (VS)
## SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)
## Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
##SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
## git
## WinMerge
## Vi
vi over emacs.

Once upon a time, I did a lot of work on Solaris. Later, I ran linux on my personal rig. 

# Languages
The only languages that I have done significant work with in the last ten years are:
## PowerShell
## Transact SQL

# Documentation and Note-taking
## [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)
I am a neophyte when it comes to Confluence.
## OneNote
Of all of the tools in the Microsoft Office Suite, the one I've never been able to give up is OneNote.

# Office
## Excel
## Office365
## OpenOffice/LibreOffice

# Office Hardware-Computing
## A [Dell](https://www.dell.com) Latitude E7450 laptop. 
This is my main rig, and has been for about a year. I have a docking port that easily connects the laptop to two Dell UltraSharp monitors.
I was very big on ThinkPads, but i don't feel that the value proposition make sense anymore.

* A [Dell](https://www.dell.com) PowerEdge T130 with a E3-1220 V5 and 32 GB of RAM, withy Hyper-V, for a lab server.
RAM has gotten pricey, or I would install another 32 GB.

* A Gigabyte Brix, model GB-BXI5H-4200 for whatnot.
This was my main rig for about three years. I am winding it's use down.

* A hand-built Core2Duo, with an Intel motherboard and a SilverStone case.
This was my main rig for about three years. I am winding it's use down.

* A Core2Duo ThinkPad
This was my main rig for about three years. I am winding it's use down. It's my "emergency" laptop. 

In my deep, dark past, I've had the following computers:
* Shuttle with an AMD processor. 
* Micron PII (IIRzc). I still have the keyboard.
* Northgate 386/33. I still have the free coffee mug that they sent me with the unit.
* A few Macintoshes, way back in the 1980s, mainly a Mac Plus that took me through university.

# Office Hardware-Network
## Ubiquiti Wireless Access Point
I'm not a network guy but the 'standard' equipment that Verizon gave me was not cutting muster.

# Office Hardware-Visuals
## A Dell 1920x1200 LCD
## A ancient & trusty Dell FP2001 1600x1200 LCD.

In the past, I've used monitors from Sony, MAG and Princeton. I tend to hold onto monitors for a long time.

# Office Hardware-Miscellaneous
## A Brother laser printer
I don't like printing things, but I have to relent sometimes.
I had a LaserJet 6P for a long time, but it did not have enough RAM to support modern documents so I had to give that up.
The Brother printer is fully networked and I think I spent less than $100 on it in 2010. It's never failed me

## A Fujitsu sheet-fed scanner
This has been a lifesaver. I'vd scanned thousands of pages to PDF and then shredded the pages.
