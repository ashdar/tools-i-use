This is a curated list of tools that I use, or have used. I use some of these things every day, some I only tinker with and a few were heavily used, at one time. 

I think that this list would just clog up the blog and I'm too lazy to set up my own wiki. 

This just an idea for now, it certainly needs editting. Actually, it is two ideas:
1. Keep a list of useful things that I can refer people to
1. Improve my Markdown skills. Nothing teaches as well as "doing" teaches. The first thing I have been taught is that GitHub's Markdown preview can be quirky.

# Organizations
* [SQLPASS](https://www.pass.org)

# Platforms
* [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows)
* [GitHub](https://www.github.com)
* [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com)
* Subversion
* [TFSOnline](https://tfsonline.microsoft.com)
* [debian](https://www.debian.org)
I used debian on my personal rigs for a couple of years. 
* ubuntu
I used ubuntu on my personal laptop for a couple of years.
* Ubuntu on Windows
I have been tinkering with this.
* Google Cloud Shell 
I tinker with this. It can be handy to be able to ping my home network from outside of the perimeter, and this is cheaper than a VPS.
* [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)
I'm really just starting out with this. I think that this is the future for many, many organizations.
* Chocolatey

# Programming Tools
* Visual Studio (VS)
* SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)
* Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
* SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
* git
* WinMerge
* Vi
Once upon a time, I did a lot of work on Solaris. Later, I ran linux on my personal rig. I prever vi over emacs.

# Languages
The only languages that I have done significant work with in the last ten years are:
* PowerShell
* Transact SQL

# Productivity
* Remember The Milk (RTM)
I use this constantly. It is good for simple tasks or very small projects. It tends to get clunky with larger projects.
* Jira
I am just getting going with Jira. Pro: It is very flexible. Con: It is very flexible.
* Trello
Trello is fine, it just feels restrictive.
* Wunderlist
I used this before switching to Remember The Milk. It's fine, but I don't know what Microsoft intends to do with it.
* Evernote
I used this extensively until I moved everything over to OneNote. I had started with Evernote as an alternative to OneNote. Microsoft's only features improved and OneNote only seemed to get less useful for me, so I switched back.

# Documentation and Note-taking
* Confluence
I am a neophyte when it comes to Confluence.
* OneNote
Of all of the tools in the Microsoft Office Suite, the one I've never been able to give up is OneNote.

# Office
* Excel
* Office365
* OpenOffice/LibreOffice

# Office Hardware
## Computing
* A Dell Latitude E7450 laptop. 
My main machine is a Dell laptop. I have a docking port that easily connects the laptop to two Dell UltraSharp monitors.
I was very big on ThinkPads, but i don't feel that the value proposition make sense anymore.

* I have a Dell PowerEdge T130 with a E3-1220 V5 and 32 GB of RAM, withy Hyper-V, for a lab server.
RAM has gotten pricey, or I would install another 32 GB.

* I have an old Gigabyte Brix, model GB-BXI5H-4200 for whatnot.
This was my main rig for about three years.

In the dark past, I've had the following computers:
Shuttle with an AMD processor
* Micron PII (IIRzc)
* Northgate 386/33
* A few Macintoshes, mainly a Mac Plus that took me through university.

## Network
* Ubiquiti Wireless Access Point
I'm not a network guy but the 'standard' equipment that Verizon gave me was not cutting muster.

## Visuals
* I have a Dell 1920x1200 LCD and my (ancient & trusty) Dell FP2001 1600x1200 LCD.
* In the past, I've used monitors from Sony, MAG and Princeton. I tend to hold onto monitors for a long time.

## Sounds
* A NAD 3155 Integrated amplifier that I picked up via eBay
* A pair of KEF model 101 bookshelf speakers that I picked up at an estate sale
* An Energy EXL-S8 Powered Subwoofer that I picked up via Craigslist
