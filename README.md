# tools-i-use
This is a curated list of tools that I use, or have used. I use some of these things every day, soeme I only tinker with and a few were heavily used, at one time. 

I think that this list would just clog up the blog and I'm too lazy to set up my own wiki. 

This just an idea for now, it certainly needs editting. Actually, it is two ideas:
1. Keep a list of useful things that I can refer people to
1. Improve my MarkDown skills. Nothing teaches as well as "doing" teaches.

I tinker with this. It can be handy to be able to ping my home network from outside of the perimeter, and this is cheaper than a VPS.
* [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)
I'm really just starting out with this. I think that this is the future for many, many organizations.

## Computing
* A Dell Latitude E7450 laptop. 
My main machine is a Dell laptop. I have a docking port that easily connects the laptop to two Dell UltraSharp monitors.

* I have a Dell PowerEdge T130 with a E3-1220 V5 and 32 GB of RAM, withy Hyper-V, for a lab server.
RAM has gotten pricey, or I would install another 32 GB.

This was my main rig for about three years.
