GitHub provides a [wiki](https://github.com/ashdar/tools-i-use/wiki), so I'll be moving these notes to the wiki as I get time.

This is a curated list of tools that I use, or have used. I use some of these things every day, some I only tinker with and a few were heavily used, at one time. 

I think that this list would just clog up the blog and I'm too lazy to set up my own wiki. 

This just an idea for now, it certainly needs editting. Actually, it is two ideas:
1. Keep a list of useful things that I can refer people to
1. Improve my Markdown skills. Nothing teaches as well as "doing" teaches. The first thing I have been taught is that GitHub's Markdown preview can be quirky.

At some point, I may convert some of my bookmarks to pages here. This makes it easier to share my learnings.

# Platforms-Version Control Systems
## [GitHub](https://www.github.com)
GitHub revolutionized online software projects. You are soaking in it right now. GitHub was purchased by Microsoft in 2018.

## [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com)

If you fear Microsoft, you are probably using GitLab.
## [TFSOnline](https://tfsonline.microsoft.com)

I used Microsoft online for a while. I still have a project or two that I can't easily open-source stored on TFS Online.
## Subversion

This was a fairly popular thing, before git took off.

# Platforms-Operating Systems
## [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows)
## [debian](https://www.debian.org)
I used debian on my personal rigs for a couple of years. When I want a linux distro, maybe to add to my car keys, I still reach for this one.
## [ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.org)
I used ubuntu on my personal laptop for a year or so.
## Ubuntu on Windows
I have been tinkering with this.
## Google Cloud Shell 
I tinker with this. It can be handy to be able to ping my home network from outside of the perimeter, and this is cheaper than a VPS.
## [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)
I'm really just starting out with this. I think that this is the future for many, many organizations.
## Chocolatey
Chocolatey is great if you don't have an absolute requirement to set up WSUS.

Once upon a time, I did a lot of work on Solaris. Later, I ran linux on my personal rig.
